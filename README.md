# Blood-Cell-Components-Detection-using-YOLOv7-tiny

Dataset: https://universe.roboflow.com/object-detection/bccd.   
This is a dataset of blood cells photos.    
There are 364 images across three classes: white blood cells), red blood cells, and Platelets.  

Steps followed in implementing YOLOv7:    
1. Clone the YOLOv7 github repository at any location you want it.  [https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7](url) 
2. Inside YOLOv7 directory, install the requirements.txt file and roboflow.
3. Download the pretrained weights.  
4. Set GPU.  
5. Set dataset configuration file.   
6. Train the model.   
7. Evaluate the model.   
8. Get inference with the trained weights.
